> My first website :)

> Where weak passwords come to die...


HackMePlz is a sarcastic yet functional password checker that roasts your weak passwords while teaching you better habits. It estimates password strength, checks if it’s been pwned, and offers brutally honest feedback — because someone had to say it.

## 💡 What is This?

**HackMePlz** is an ironic but functional password checker built with:

- **Tailwind CSS** for styling  
- **JavaScript** with the Have I Been Pwned API for actual breach checks
- **Sarcastic, feedback** to shame your bad security choices  


## ⚙️ How It Works

1. You enter your *tragic excuse of a password*
2. It gets SHA-1 hashed client-side
3. It pings the **HIBP API**
4. You get feedback based on how many times that password has shown up in breaches
